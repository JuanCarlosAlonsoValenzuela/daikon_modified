# DAIKON
This is a modified version of the Daikon invariant detector version 5.8.10, configured for detecting invariants
in the context of RESTful APIs. The original software can be found here: https://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/

This version of Daikon has been modified by suppressing specific invariants (that could result in the generation of
false positives) and adding new domain-specific invariants.

# Invariants
## Suppressed invariants
Invariants can be suppressed by commenting its corresponding line in the setup_proto_invs function of the Daikon.java
file. The following invariants have been suppressed:

- IntNonEqual
- FloatNonEqual
- StringNonEqual
- StringLessThan
- StringGreaterThan
- StringLessEqual
- StringGreaterEqual


## New invariants
### Unary invariants
- Url (True if a string is a URL)

# Derived variables
## Suppressed derived variables
